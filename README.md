# telegram-codex-app-bridge

Use a Telegram bot to control a local Codex Desktop instance through `codex app-server`.

## Features

- Telegram private chat or topic-aware group control for a single allowed user
- Local `codex app-server` transport over loopback WebSocket
- Sticky chat-to-thread binding with `/threads`, `/open`, `/new`, `/where`, `/interrupt`
- Chat-scoped preference control with `/setup`: model, reasoning effort, Fast service tier, access preset, and Agent/Plan mode
- Quick Fast service-tier control with `/fast on`, `/fast off`, and `/fast toggle`
- Deep-link sync from Telegram into `Codex.app` with `/open` and `/reveal`
- Inline approval buttons for command and file-change approvals
- SQLite persistence for bindings, offsets, approvals, and audit logs
- Stable segmented live rendering across private chat and topic/group modes
- Bottom activity cards for `thinking`, `browsing`, `approval`, `interrupt`, and tool summaries
- Single-instance process lock to prevent duplicate Telegram polling on the same bot token

## Requirements

- macOS with Codex Desktop installed
- `codex` CLI available and authenticated
- Node.js 24+
- A Telegram bot token from `@BotFather`
- Your Telegram numeric user id

## Setup

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run build
npm run doctor
npm run serve
```

## Codex Skill

This repo also ships a Codex skill at [`skills/chat-to-codex`](./skills/chat-to-codex).

Use it when you want Codex to:

- bootstrap this bridge on the current Mac
- copy the same setup to another Mac over SSH
- install Node.js 24 and the Codex CLI without relying on Homebrew
- write the bridge `.env`, build the repo, run doctor, and optionally install launchd

## Telegram Setup

1. Create a bot with `@BotFather` and copy the bot token into `TG_BOT_TOKEN`.
2. Get your Telegram numeric user id and place it into `TG_ALLOWED_USER_ID`.
3. Optional for group/topic mode: add `TG_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` and `TG_ALLOWED_TOPIC_ID`.
4. Start the bridge locally with `npm run serve`.
5. Open a private chat with the bot and send `/help`, or talk to it in the configured Telegram topic.

The bridge accepts messages only from the configured Telegram user id.

## Interaction Modes

The bridge intentionally uses different Telegram renderers depending on the conversation type:

| Conversation type | Renderer | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Private chat | Segmented live messages + bottom status card | Default stable renderer; keeps partial output visible |
| Private chat topic | Segmented live messages + bottom status card | Same as private chat, but with `message_thread_id` |
| Group topic | Segmented messages + bottom status card | Fallback mode; no draft streaming |
| Group chat without topic | Segmented messages + bottom status card | Supported, but less structured than topic mode |

Practical guidance:

- Prefer private chat if you want the simplest and most stable live experience.
- Prefer one bot per topic if you keep multiple bots in the same group.
- Group/topic mode is a compatibility path, not the richest renderer.

## Configuration Model

Each device only needs one bot and one `.env` file. Use the same template in all cases:

```dotenv
TG_BOT_TOKEN=123456:telegram-token
TG_ALLOWED_USER_ID=123456789
TG_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID=
TG_ALLOWED_TOPIC_ID=
CODEX_APP_AUTOLAUNCH=true
CODEX_APP_LAUNCH_CMD=codex app
CODEX_APP_SYNC_ON_OPEN=true
CODEX_APP_SYNC_ON_TURN_COMPLETE=false
DEFAULT_CWD=/Users/ganxing/Downloads
DEFAULT_APPROVAL_POLICY=on-request
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_MODE=workspace-write
```

How the optional Telegram fields work:

- Leave `TG_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` empty: private-chat mode
- Set `TG_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` only: one allowed group becomes the default conversation scope
- Set both `TG_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` and `TG_ALLOWED_TOPIC_ID`: that topic becomes the default conversation scope

If multiple bots share one group, each bot should use:

- Its own `TG_BOT_TOKEN`
- The same `TG_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID`
- A different `TG_ALLOWED_TOPIC_ID`

Without `TG_ALLOWED_TOPIC_ID`, every bot in the same group treats the whole group as its default scope.

## Commands

- `/help`
- `/setup` opens the unified preference panel
- `/fast <on|off|toggle>` toggles the current chat's Fast service tier when the selected model supports it
- `/status`
- `/threads [query]`
- `/open <n>`
- `/new [cwd]`
- `/models`, `/model`, `/effort`, `/permissions`, `/access`, `/mode`, `/plan`, and `/agent` open the same panel with the relevant section focused when no value is provided
- `/model <model>`, `/effort <effort>`, `/permissions <read-only|default|full-access>`, `/access <read-only|default|full-access>`, and `/mode <default|plan>` still apply values directly
- `/reveal`
- `/where`
- `/interrupt`
- Plain text sends to the current thread, or creates a new one if none is bound.

## Telegram Group Checklist

If you use a group or supergroup, do all of the following before testing natural-language chat:

1. Add the bot to the target group.
2. Disable the bot's `privacy mode` in `@BotFather`.
3. Promote the bot to administrator in that group.
4. If you disabled `privacy mode` after the bot was already in the group and natural-language messages still do not arrive, remove the bot and add it back.

Notes:

- `privacy mode` is not required for private chat.
- `/status@botname` and other explicit commands may work even when natural-language group messages do not. Do not use command success as proof that group natural-language mode is configured correctly.
- Topic mode is optional. It is recommended when multiple bots share one group.

## Recommended Usage

The bridge supports three practical layouts:

- Private chat: simplest setup, no group, no topic
- Single bot in one group: set `TG_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID`, keep `TG_ALLOWED_TOPIC_ID` empty unless you want a default topic
- Multiple bots in one group: recommended to use one topic per bot

Recommended group behavior:

- In the bot's default topic, send natural-language messages directly
- In `General` or other topics, explicitly address the bot with `@botname` or `/command@botname`

Recommended mobile preference flow:

- Send `/setup` to review the current model, effort, Fast, access, and Agent/Plan mode in one message
- Use `/fast on` or `/fast off` when you only need to switch the service tier
- Use direct commands such as `/model gpt-5`, `/effort high`, `/permissions full-access`, and `/mode plan` when copy-paste is faster than tapping buttons

## Behavior Boundaries

What is intentionally supported now:

- Private chats and topics use segmented live messages so visible partial output is not overwritten by generic status text
- Group topics use segmented messages, activity cards, and archived tool summaries
- Tool actions such as `Read ...`, `Searched for ...`, `Ran ...`, and edit operations are summarized separately from the assistant body
- Interrupt and approval states are shown as their own activity states instead of being mixed into generic "working" text

What still remains an approximation of Codex App:

- Telegram does not give this bridge the same native multi-panel surface as Codex App, so activity and body still share one linear chat timeline
- If Telegram or the network briefly fails, the bridge retries rendering, but the UI can still be less fluid than Codex App
- A bridge restart can retire stale live cards and preserve thread context, but it cannot reconstruct every in-flight delta exactly

## Finding Chat And Topic IDs

To discover `TG_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID` and `TG_ALLOWED_TOPIC_ID`:

1. Stop the bridge.
2. Send a message in the target group or topic.
3. Open `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/getUpdates`.
4. Read:
   - `message.chat.id` -> `TG_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID`
   - `message.message_thread_id` -> `TG_ALLOWED_TOPIC_ID`

If the bridge is still running, it may consume the update before you inspect it.

## Example Group Config

```dotenv
TG_BOT_TOKEN=123456:telegram-token
TG_ALLOWED_USER_ID=123456789
TG_ALLOWED_CHAT_ID=-1001234567890
TG_ALLOWED_TOPIC_ID=42
CODEX_APP_AUTOLAUNCH=true
CODEX_APP_LAUNCH_CMD=codex app
CODEX_APP_SYNC_ON_OPEN=true
CODEX_APP_SYNC_ON_TURN_COMPLETE=false
DEFAULT_CWD=/Users/ganxing/Downloads
DEFAULT_APPROVAL_POLICY=on-request
DEFAULT_SANDBOX_MODE=workspace-write
```

This is the common setup for one bot bound to one topic inside one group.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

- Group command works, but natural language does not:
  Usually `privacy mode` is still on, the bot is not admin, or the bot needs to be re-added after the privacy change.
- `getUpdates` shows no recent message:
  Stop the bridge first, then send a fresh message and check again.
- Multiple bots answer in the same group:
  Give each bot a different `TG_ALLOWED_TOPIC_ID`, or keep bots in separate groups.
- The same bot starts replying twice or Telegram shows polling conflicts:
  Make sure only one bridge process is running for that bot. This repo now uses a local lock file to block a second instance on the same Mac.
- A message seemed to get no reply:
  Check the latest activity card and streamed body below it. The bridge keeps partial output visible instead of replacing it with a generic loading line.
